## AI functions harness the power of GenAI for summarization, classification, text generation, and so much more â€” all with a single line of code:

### Thanks to a new set of AI functions for data engineering, Microsoft Fabric users can now harness the power of industry-leading large language models (LLMs) to transform and enrich data seamlessly.

- Calculate similarity with *ai.similarity*: Compare the meaning of input text with a single common text value, or with corresponding text values in another column.
- Categorize text with *ai.classify*: Classify input text values according to labels you choose.
- Detect sentiment with *ai.analyze_sentiment*: Identify the emotional state expressed by input text.
- Extract entities with *ai.extract*: Find and extract specific types of information from input text, for example locations or names.
- Fix grammar with *ai.fix_grammar*: Correct the spelling, grammar, and punctuation of input text.
- Summarize text with *ai.summarize*: Get summaries of input text.
- Translate text with *ai.translate*: Translate input text into another language.
- Answer custom user prompts with *ai.generate_response*: Generate responses based on your own instructions.
